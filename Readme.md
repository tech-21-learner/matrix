# Matrix
In this project, I did matrix addition, subtration and multiplication with the help of user-defined datatype(class and struct). There are in total three files matrix.cpp, matrix.h and main.cpp.

1.In Matrix.h :-
    I have stated user defined datatypes named MatrixType, MatrixValue, MatrixNode, and Matrix.
    ->struct MatrixValue: contains int variables.
    ->struct MatrixNode: contais MatrixNode type pointer.
    ->Class MatrixType and Matrix: both contains required functions to perform arithmetix operations on the matrix
